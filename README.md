CPC Valve Industry Web

A custom industry website built for CPC Valve, focused on simplicity, clarity, and a better user experience for industrial users.

This project avoids the traditional product based structure. Instead, it uses categories and category types as the main way to manage pages and content.

About the Project

CPC Valve Industry Web is built using Custom HTML and Custom PHP, with WordPress used only as a CMS.

The main idea is to simplify content management and navigation by treating categories as real pages, not just labels.

Core Idea
