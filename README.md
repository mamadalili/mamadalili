CPC Valve Industry Web

A purpose built industrial website for CPC Valve, designed with a clear focus on usability, structure, and long term maintainability.

This project is not a typical product driven website. It is built around a category first architecture, tailored for industrial and technical content where clarity matters more than shopping features.

What This Project Is

CPC Valve Industry Web is a custom web solution built using:

Custom HTML for a clean and controlled frontend

Custom PHP for flexible logic and rendering

WordPress used strictly as a CMS, not a page builder

The system is designed to scale without becoming complex or fragile over time.

The Core Approach

Instead of managing dozens or hundreds of product pages, the website treats categories as real pages.

The structure is based on:

Categories as primary content pages

Category Types as a logical layer for navigation and grouping

Custom templates that dynamically render category content

This approach better matches how industrial users search, read, and decide.

Why This Matters

Industrial websites are not e commerce stores.
They are decision support tools.

This structure helps:

Users find relevant solutions faster

Content stay organized as it grows

Teams update content without breaking the site

Search engines understand content relationships better
